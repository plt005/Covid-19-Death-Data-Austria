# Covid-19-Death-Data-Austria
In this repository, I've created a list of COVID-19 dead, using news articles and press releases.
The list is divided by state and contains age, gender, previous illnesses and the source.
The list is not complete, because many states, among them Vienna, do not report case specific information on new deaths anymore.
If an entry is missing in the list, this means that the information is not available.
